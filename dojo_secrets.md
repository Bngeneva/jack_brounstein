#Dojo Secrets

###User Login:

* First and last name (can't be blank)
* E-mail (must be valid address)
* Password (must be at least 8 characters)

###Secrets:

* Users can post secrets, delete secrets that they posted, and like secrets posted by others.
* On the index page, display the 5 or 10 most recent secrets. Also include a "Most Popular" page, which shows all secrets, sorted by number of likes (most likes is first).
* On both index and "Most Popular" page, show how many likes the secrets has received, a link to like that secret if the user hasn't already, and--if the logged-in user posted this secret--an option to delete. Also show when the secret was posted.
* Secrets are anonymous--never display the name or E-mail of the person who posted the secret.
